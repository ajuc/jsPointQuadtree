	<p>
	jsPointQuadtree is a library that allows you to create, fill, modify, serialize and deserialize
	quadtrees of values assigned to points.	Inteded use is to keep compressed tile map for 2d game. It will work the best, when most of the map
	contains the same value (in the sense of === operator).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Assumptions: we have square grid, width == height == power of 2.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	At each point in this grid we can have some value. This quad tree can keep such
	data more efficiently, than regular 2d grid, if there are many regions with equal values
	(in the sense of === operator, or (when I'll implement it), in the sense of anonymous
	boolean function, supplied by the user of the library to the constructor of the quadtree).
	</p>
	
	Creating the quadtree:
	<code>
		var coordinates = [0, 0, 3, 3]; //x0, y0, x1, y1
		var options = {'joinSameValues': true}; // true if we want to optimize the tree after each insert
		var qt = new ajuc.jsPointQuadtree.Quadtree(coordinates, options);
	</code>
	At the start every point has null value.
	
	Adding points to the tree:
	<code>
		qt.add([1,2], 112);
		qt.add([2,2], "Marry had a lamb");
		qt.add([3,0], {"a": 1}); // value can be anything, but more complicated values
								 // (without nice ===) won't be compacted into one node
								 // when tree is optimized, so tree can grow huge
	</code>

	Getting values from the tree:
	<code>
		var value = qt.valueAt([0,0]); //null
		var value = qt.valueAt([1,2]); //112
		var value = qt.valueAt([2,2]); //"Marry had a lamb"
		var value = qt.valueAt([3,0]); //{"a": 1}
	</code>
	
	Serialization:
	<code>
		var serialized = qt.toString();
	</code>
	
	Deserialization:
	<code>
		var qt = new ajuc.jsPointQuadtree.Quadtree([0,0,0,0], {null, null, null, null});
		qt.fromString(serialized);
	</code>
