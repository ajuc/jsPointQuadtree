	jsPointQuadtree is a library that allows you to create, fill, modify, serialize and deserialize
	quadtrees of values assigned to points.
	
	Inteded use is to keep compressed tile map for 2d game. It will work the best, when most of the map
	contains the same value (in the sense of === operator).

	Useless for keeping objects (lke enemies, buildings, players), in it. Also useless for space indexing.

	Assumptions: we have square grid, width == height == power of 2.

	At each point in this grid we can have some value. This quad tree can keep such
	data more efficiently, than regular 2d grid, if there are many regions with equal values
	(in the sense of === operator, or (wehn I'll implement it), in the sense of anonymous
	boolean function, supplied by the user of the library to the constructor of the quadtree).

	Compression is efficient for sparse grids, or grids with big regions of the same values.
	
	Usage:
