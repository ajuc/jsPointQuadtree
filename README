This is simple implementation of quadtree of points.

Useful for compressing tiled maps, raster images, etc.
Useless for keeping objects (lke enemies, buildings, players),  in it.
Also useless for space indexing.

Assumptions: we have square grid,
width == height == power of 2.

At each point in this grid we can have some value. This quad tree can keep such
data more efficiently, than regular 2d grid, if there are many regions with equal values
(in the sense of === operator, or (in the future), in the sense of anonymous boolean function,
supplied by the user of the library to the constructor of the quadtree).

Work in progress (recursively joining same elements into one node doesn't work yet).

Library has no dependnencies.

Unit tests are (surprisignly) in test.html , and use jquery and qunit, just to test the library .
